PackageDescription: The libevent API provides a mechanism to execute a callback function when a specific event occurs on a file descriptor or after a timeout has been reached. Furthermore, libevent also support callbacks due to signals or regular timeouts.  libevent is meant to replace the event loop found in event driven network servers. An application just needs to call event_dispatch() and then add or remove events dynamically without having to change the event loop.  Currently, libevent supports /dev/poll, kqueue(2), event ports, select(2), poll(2) and epoll(4). The internal event mechanism is completely independent of the exposed event API, and a simple update of libevent can provide new functionality without having to redesign the applications. As a result, Libevent allows for portable application development and provides the most scalable event notification mechanism available on an operating system. Libevent can also be used for multi-threaded applications; see Steven Grimm’s explanation. Libevent should compile on Linux, *BSD, Mac OS X, Solaris and Windows

PackageDescription: The Bastille Hardening program “locks down” an operating system, proactively configuring the system for increased security and decreasing its susceptibility to compromise. Bastille can also assess a system’s current state of hardening, granularly reporting on each of the security settings with which it works.  Bastille currently supports the Red Hat (Fedora Core, Enterprise, and Numbered/Classic), SUSE, Debian, Gentoo, and Mandrake distributions, along with HP-UX. Full Mac OS X is ready for download today. Bastille’s focuses on letting the system’s user/administrator choose exactly how to harden the operating system. In its default hardening mode, it interactively asks the user questions, explains the topics of those questions, and builds a policy based on the user’s answers. It then applies the policy to the system. In its assessment mode, it builds a report intended to teach the user about available security settings as well as inform the user as to which settings have been tightened.

PackageDescription: bc is a language that supports arbitrary precision numbers with interactive execution of statements. There are some similarities in the syntax to the C programming language. A standard math library is available by command line option. If requested, the math library is defined before processing any files. bc starts by processing code from all the files listed on the command line in the order listed. After all files have been processed, bc reads from the standard input. All code is executed as it is read. (If a file contains a command to halt the processor, bc will never read from the standard input.)  This version of bc contains several extensions beyond traditional bc implementations and the POSIX draft standard. Command line options can cause these extensions to print a warning or to be rejected. This document describes the language accepted by this processor. Extensions will be identified as such.

It provides a highlevel interface to the implemented protocols and presents the data in a consistent way. There is no more need to worry about all the nasty details of the protocols. The API gives the C programmer an easy way of interacting with the data. It copes with the version details X.509 protocols tend to have as well as with the many different versions and dialects. Applications must usually cope with all of this and it has to be coded over and over again. Libksba hides this by providing just one API which does the Right Thing. Support for new features will be added as needed.

PackageDescription: The GNU Binary Utilities, or binutils, is a collection of programming tools for the manipulation of object code in various object file formats. The current versions were originally written by programmers at Cygnus Solutions using the Binary File Descriptor library (libbfd). They are typically used in conjunction with GNU Compiler Collection, make, and GDB.  Originally the package consisted of only the minor utilities, but later the GNU Assembler (GAS) and GNU Linker (GLD) were included in releases, since their functionality is so closely related.  Most of the binutils are rather simple programs. Most of the complexity is encapsulated in the Binary File Descriptor library and libopcodes libraries, which they share.  The original BFD versions were written by David Henkel-Wallace and Steve Chamberlain. Past maintainers have included Ken Raeburn and Ian Lance Taylor. As of 2005[update] the current maintainer is Nick Clifton.  Binutils for Linux is maintained by H.J. Lu.

PackageDescription: Allows low-level manipulation of TCP/IP headers that is impossible for normal programs. Key point: Most programs go through a high-level interface (like sockets) in order to send traffic on the network. Sometimes, for security or hacking reasons, a program needs to construct its own network headers. The existing TCP/IP stack is unable to build these headers, so you must bypass it and go directly to the hardware drivers. Libnet is a library that makes custom packet generation easier. Misunderstanding: Some people believe that libnet will not work on Win95 or WinNT because these systems do not support raw sockets. This is false — libnet has been widely used on these platforms.

BLT is an extension to the Tk toolkit, adding new widgets, geometry managers, and miscellaneous commands. It does not require any patching of the Tcl or Tk source files. An attempt is being made to unify the BLT libraries so that the package is independent of whatever tcl/tk library (e.g. 8.0,8.2,8.3) you are using. This will be via the tcl stubs interface. As part of this process, blt8.0 is obsolete and this package dynamically chooses the correct version of BLT library to match your situation. This makes is a lot bigger than if you choose the library versions yourself, but means that you always have the version you need (not always the case under the old system).

PackageDescription: Tracks runtime library calls in dynamically linked programs ltrace is a debugging program which runs a specified command until it exits. While the command is executing, ltrace intercepts and records the dynamic library calls which are called by the executed process and the signals received by that process. It can also intercept and print the system calls executed by the program. The program to be traced need not be recompiled for this, so you can use it on binaries for which you don’t have the source handy. You should install ltrace if you need a sysadmin tool for tracking the execution of processes.

PackageDescription: The Boehm-Demers-Weiser conservative garbage collector can be used as a garbage collecting replacement for C malloc or C++ new. It allows you to allocate memory basically as you normally would, without explicitly deallocating memory that is no longer useful. The collector automatically recycles memory when it determines that it can no longer be otherwise accessed. A simple example of such a use is given here.  The collector is also used by a number of programming language implementations that either use C as intermediate code, want to facilitate easier interoperation with C libraries, or just prefer the simple collector interface. For a more detailed description of the interface, see here.  Alternatively, the garbage collector may be used as a leak detector for C or C++ programs, though that is not its primary goal.  The arguments for and against conservative garbage collection in C and C++ are briefly discussed in issues.html. The beginnings of a frequently-asked-questions list are here.  Empirically, this collector works with most unmodified C programs, simply by replacing malloc with GC_malloc calls, replacing realloc with GC_realloc calls, and removing free calls. Exceptions are discussed in issues.html.

PackageDescription: microcode.ctl: Intel IA32 CPU Microcode Utility The microcode_ctl utility is a companion to the IA32 microcode driver written by Tigran Aivazian ( tigran@veritas.com). The utility has two uses: a) it decodes and sends new microcode to the kernel driver to be uploaded to Intel IA32 family processors. (Pentium Pro, PII, Celeron, PIII, Xeon, Pentium 4 etc.) b) it signals the kernel driver to release any buffers it may hold The microcode update is volatile and needs to be uploaded on each system boot i.e. it doesn’t re-flash your CPU permanently, reboot and it reverts back to the old microcode. The ideal place to load microcode is in BIOS, but most vendors never update it! To enable microcode update, I need some kernel support, thus I need the linux kernel 2.2.18 or later, or 2.4.0 or later. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

PackageDescription: Mkinitrd creates filesystem images for use as initial ramdisk (initrd) images. These ramdisk images are often used to preload the block device modules (SCSI or RAID) needed to access the root filesystem. In other words, generic kernels can be built without drivers for any SCSI adapters which load the SCSI driver as a module. Since the kernel needs to read those modules, but in this case it isn’t able to address the SCSI adapter, an initial ramdisk is used. The initial ramdisk is loaded by the operating system loader (normally LILO) and is available to the kernel as soon as the ramdisk is loaded. The ramdisk image loads the proper SCSI adapter and allows the kernel to mount the root filesystem. The mkinitrd program creates such a ramdisk using information found in the /etc/ modules.conf file.

PackageDescription: The module-init-tools are a set of programs for loading, inserting, and removing Kernel Modules for Linux (versions 2.5.48 and above). It serves the same function that the modutils package serves for Linux 2.4. They are necessary because starting with 2.5.51, modules are handled differently. Every symbol of a module has versioning information, so that the Kernel can read the module and what hooks it uses, compare it to an internal database of what’s critical and what’s not, and decide whether the module can be used, even if it wasn’t compiled specifically for the current running Kernel. This adds a lot more flexibility for people forced to run BinaryDrivers.

This version has many features which make it appear similar in some respects to the Korn shell, but it is not a Korn shell clone (see ksh(1)). Only features designated by POSIX plus a few Berkeley extensions, are being incorporated into this shell. We expect POSIX conformance by the time 4.4 BSD is released. This man page is not intended to be a tutorial or a complete specification of the shell.

PackageDescription: The Network Mapper nmap is a utility for port scanning large networks, although it works fine for single hosts. The guiding philosophy for the creation of nmap was TMTOWTDI (There’s More Than One Way To Do It). This is the Perl slogan, but it is equally applicable to scanners. Sometimes you need speed, other times you may need stealth. In some cases, bypassing firewalls may be required. Not to mention the fact that you may want to scan different protocols (UDP, TCP, ICMP, etc.). You just can’t do all this with one scanning mode. And you don’t want to have 10 different scanners around, all with different interfaces. Thus I incorporated virtually every scanning technique I know into nmap. Specifically, nmap supports: Vanilla TCP connect() scanning, TCP SYN (half open) scanning, TCP FIN (stealth) scanning, TCP ftp proxy (bounce attack) scanning SYN/FIN scanning using IP fragments (bypasses packet filters), UDP recvfrom() scanning, UDP raw ICMP port unreachable scanning, ICMP scanning (ping-sweep), and Reverse-ident scanning. nmap also supports a number of performance and reliability features such as dynamic delay time calculations, packet timeout and retransmission, parallel port scanning, detection of down hosts via parallel pings, and flexible target and port specification.

PackageDescription: Network UPS Tools This daemon can monitor a large assortment of UPS hardware and can provide notification to other computers via it’s client/ server architecture. One computer is configured to act as a master and the others are configured as slaves. This package provides the best features of the other Debian UPS packages but is not based on any of them. Specifically, it is better because: 1) it has the ability to talk to a wide variety of hardware in both dumb and smart modes, similar to genpower; and 2) it has network capability in that it can act as a UPS server (master) for other UPS client boxes (slaves), similar to apcd. Finally, the companion package, nut-cgi, provides cgi scripts that can display the status of UPS on a web page. (potato debs can be found at http://people.debian.org/~lfilipoz)

As such, it doesn’t have a lot of snazzy features as do some of the other vi clones such as elvis and vim. However, if all you want is vi, this is the one to get.

It provides minimalist replacements for the most common utilities you would usually find on your desktop system (i.e., ls, cp, mv, mount, tar, etc.). The utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options than their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included provide the expected functionality and behave very much like their GNU counterparts. This package installs the BusyBox binary but does not install symlinks for any of the supported utilities. You can use /bin/ busybox –install to install BusyBox to the current directory (you do not want to do this in / on your Debian system!).

PackageDescription: Analyzes resource usage and performance characteristics of running containers cAdvisor (Container Advisor) provides container users an understanding of the resource usage and performance characteristics of their running containers. It is a running daemon that collects, aggregates, processes, and exports information about running containers. Specifically, for each container it keeps resource isolation parameters, historical resource usage, histograms of complete historical resource usage and network statistics. This data is exported by container and machine-wide. cAdvisor currently supports lmctfy containers as well as Docker containers (those that use the default libcontainer execdriver). Other container backends can also be added. cAdvisor’s container abstraction is based on lmctfy’s so containers are inherently nested hierarchically.

PackageDescription: Security updates to products are often referred to as “patches” because they fix one small part of the product rather than updating the entire product. Analogy: Imagine that you are in a rubber raft that seems to be sinking. You look around on the boat and see small holes. You use your patch kit to fix the small holes rather than building yourself a new boat. Key point: The software you are using today likely has security holes that nobody has discovered yet. It seems unlikely, but this has been the historical precidence, whether you are using open-source (e.g. Linux), Microsoft products, or class UNIX systems (e.g. Sun). Therefore, if you don’t keep up with the latest software, you will eventually get hacked. From Hacking-Lexicon

PackageDescription: PCMCIA Card Services for Linux. PCMCIA cards are commonly used in laptops to provide expanded capabilities, such as modems, increased memory, etc. Some desktop PCs can accept PCMCIA cards as well, although this is rare. Card Services for Linux is a complete PCMCIA support package. It includes a set of client drivers for specific cards, and a card manager daemon that can respond to card insertion and removal events, loading and unloading drivers on demand. It supports “hot swapping” of PCMCIA cards, so cards can be inserted and ejected at any time. The actual kernel modules required for this package are contained in the pcmcia-modules-(kernel version) package, where (kernel version) is the version of the kernel for which the modules have been compiled. The wireless-tools package is required by wireless network adapters. The hotplug package is required by 2.4 (and later) series kernels to use PCI (Cardbus) devices.

For example, if you only needed boolean on-off values, you can store eight values in one byte. If your values require more than byte sized bits, the bits you require can still be packed more efficiently; if you need 10 bits, you can pack eight of those in an ten byte string (rather than the 16 or 32 bytes you might otherwise use).

For a shorter message you can use carp or croak which report the error as being from where your module was called. There is no guarantee that that is where the error was, but it is a good educated guess.

PackageDescription: This module opens a config file and parses its contents for you. The new method requires one parameter which needs to be a filename. The method getall returns a hash which contains all options and its associated values of your config file. The format of config files supported by Config::General is inspired by the well known Apache config format, in fact, this module is 100% compatible to Apache configs, but you can also just use simple name/value pairs in your config files. In addition to the capabilities of an Apache config file it supports some enhancements such as here-documents, C-style comments or multiline options.

PackageDescription: This pragma allows you to declare constants at compile-time: use constant PI => 4 * atan2(1, 1); When you declare a constant such as “PI” using the method shown above, each machine your script runs upon can have as many digits of accuracy as it can use. Also, your program will be easier to read, more likely to be maintained (and maintained correctly), and far less likely to send a space probe to the wrong planet because nobody noticed the one equation in which you wrote 3.14195. When a constant is used in an expression, Perl replaces it with its value at compile time, and may then optimize the expression further. In particular, any code in an “if (CONSTANT)” block will be optimized away if the constant is false.

This value can be positive or negative, though POSIX only requires support for positive values, so dates before the system’s epoch may not work on all operating systems.

PackageDescription: Cdrecord is used to record data or audio Compact Discs on an Orange Book CD-Recorder.  The device refers to scsibus/target/lun of the CD-Recorder. Communication on SunOS is done with the SCSI general driver scg. Other operating systems are using a library simulation of this driver. Possible syntax is: dev= scsibus,target,lun or dev= target,lun. In the latter case, the CD-Recorder has to be connected to the default SCSI bus of the machine. Scsibus, target and lun are integer numbers. Some operating systems or SCSI transport implementations may require to specify a filename in addition. In this case the correct syntax for the device is: dev= devicename:scsibus,target,lun or dev= devicename:target,lun. If the name of the device node that has been specified on such a system refers to exactly one SCSI device, a shorthand in the form dev= devicename:@ or dev= devicename:@,lun may be used instead of dev= devicename:scsibus,target,lun.

PackageDescription: Postfix is a Mail Transport Agent (MTA), supporting LDAP, SMTP AUTH (SASL), TLS and running in a chroot environment. Postfix is Wietse Venema’s mailer that started life as an alternative to the widely-used Sendmail program. Postfix attempts to be fast, easy to administer, and secure, while at the same time being sendmail compatible enough to not upset existing users. Thus, the outside has a sendmail-ish flavor, but the inside is completely different. This software was formerly known as VMailer. It was released by the end of 1998 as the IBM Secure Mailer. From then on it has lived on as Postfix. This rpm supports LDAP, SMTP AUTH (trough cyrus-sasl) and TLS. If you need MySQL too, rebuild the srpm –with mysql.

PackageDescription: The Secure Sockets layer is only actually secure if you check the hostname in the certificate returned by the server to which you are connecting, and verify that it matches to hostname that you are trying to reach. But the matching logic, defined in RFC2818, can be a bit tricky to implement on your own. So the ssl package in the Standard Library of Python 3.2 now includes a match_hostname() function for performing this check instead of requiring every application to implement the check separately. This backport brings match_hostname() to users of earlier versions of Python. The actual code inside comes verbatim from Python 3.2.

PackageDescription: chkconfig provides a simple command-line tool for maintaining the /etc/rc[0-6].d directory hierarchy by relieving system administrators of the task of directly manipulating the numerous symbolic links in those directories.  This implementation of chkconfig was inspired by the chkconfig command present in the IRIX operating system. Rather than maintaining configuration information outside of the /etc/rc[0-6].d hierarchy, however, this version directly manages the symlinks in /etc/rc[0-6].d. This leaves all of the configuration information regarding what services init starts in a single location.

An enumeration is a set of symbolic names (members) bound to unique, constant values. Within an enumeration, the members can be compared by identity, and the enumeration itself can be iterated over. This module defines two enumeration classes that can be used to define unique sets of names and values: Enum and IntEnum. It also defines one decorator, unique, that ensures only unique member names are present in an enumeration.

PackageDescription: Paramiko (a combination of the esperanto words for “paranoid” and “friend”) is a module for python 2.3 or greater that implements the SSH2 protocol for secure (encrypted and authenticated) connections to remote machines. Unlike SSL (aka TLS), the SSH2 protocol does not require heirarchical certificates signed by a powerful central authority. You may know SSH2 as the protocol that replaced telnet and rsh for secure access to remote shells, but the protocol also includes the ability to open arbitrary channels to remote services across an encrypted tunnel. (This is how sftp works, for example.)

It includes a powerful debugger, full featured request and response objects, HTTP utilities to handle entity tags, cache control headers, HTTP dates, cookie handling, file uploads, a powerful URL routing system and a bunch of community contributed addon modules. Werkzeug is unicode aware and doesn’t enforce a specific template engine, database adapter or anything else. It doesn’t even enforce a specific way of handling requests and leaves all that up to the developer. It’s most useful for end user applications which should work on as many server environments as possible (such as blogs, wikis, bulletin boards, etc.).

RRD is a system to store and display time-series data (i.e. network bandwidth, machine-room temperature, server load average). It stores the data in a very compact way that will not expand over time, and it presents useful graphs by processing the data to enforce a certain data density. It can be used either via simple wrapper scripts (from shell or Perl) or via frontends that poll network devices and put friendly user interface on it. This package contains command line programs used to access and manipulate RRDs.

PackageDescription: RSA Reference Implementation. This was a fairly open implementation of the RSA algorithm that has been embedded into many problems. This is not the source code that RSA sells to vendors, but an open-source version that has been imbedded within freeware/open-source products (like ssh). A patent-license is still required when using this code in commercial products, though. Key point: RSAREF has been supported by RSA (the company) for a long time, and a number of security holes have been found in this implementation. RSA wants people to use the BSAFE development kit instead. In late 1999 in particular, a bug was found that allows ssh to be hacked.

PackageDescription: The rt-watchdog program, written by User:Vhmauery is a general userspace watchdog program to prevent the system from being taken over by runaway real-time processes. It launches two threads: the first a SCHED_FIFO 99 thread that runs periodically; the second, a SCHED_OTHER thread that is the canary. When the canary is starved, it stops singing and the watchdog presumes that some (often the number of CPUs) number of processes are hogging all the CPU time. When this happens, it takes some action to remedy the situation. The default action is to kill one or more processes. So it looks at all the real-time threads and processes currently running and determines which ones are taking the most time and kills them systematically.

PackageDescription: Samba-server provides a SMB server which can be used to provide network services to SMB (sometimes called “Lan Manager”) clients. Samba uses NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NetBT) protocols and does NOT need NetBEUI (Microsoft Raw NetBIOS frame) protocol. Samba-2.2 features working NT Domain Control capability andincludes the SWAT (Samba Web Administration Tool) that allows samba’s smb.conf file to be remotely managed using your favourite web browser. For the time being this is being enabled on TCP port 901 via xinetd. SWAT is now included init’s own subpackage, samba-swat. Users are advised to use Samba-2.2 as a Windows NT4 Domain Controller only on networks that do NOT have a WindowsNT Domain Controller. This release does NOT as yet have Backup Domain control ability. Please refer to the WHATSNEW.txt document for fixup information. This binary release includes encrypted password support. Please read the smb.conf file and ENCRYPTION.txt in the docs directory for implementation details. From Mandrake 9.0 RPM

PackageDescription: Stand-alone shell. sash serves as an interactive substitute for /bin/sh, for use when /bin/sh is unusable. It’s statically linked, and inludes many standard utilities as builtins (type “help” at the prompt for a reference list). If you’ve installed sash before rendering your system unbootable, and you have some knowledge of how your system is supposed to work, you might be able to repair your system using init=/bin/sash at the boot prompt. Some people also prefer to have sash available as the shell for a root account (perhaps an under an alternate name such as sashroot) Configuration support is included for people who want this. Note: sash is not intended to serve as /bin/sh, and has few of the interactive features present in bash or ksh. It’s designed to be simple and robust, for people who need to do emergency repair work on a system. Also note: sash doesn’t include a built-in fsck — fsck is too big and complicated. If you need fsck, you’ll have to get at least one partition or disk working well enough to run fsck. More generally, sash is but one tool of many (backups, backup recovery tools, emergency boot disks or partitions, spare parts, testing of disaster plans, etc.) to help you recover a damaged system.

PackageDescription: CMAN is a symmetric, general-purpose, kernel-based cluster manager. It has two parts. Connection Manager (cnxman) handles membership, messaging, quorum, event notification and transitions. Service Manager (sm) handles “service groups” which are a general way of representing and managing instances of external systems that require cluster management. The CMAN cluster manager is the foundational system upon which DLM, GFS, CLVM, and Fence all depend. The CMAN API in the kernel and userspace is general and available for other programs to use.  CMAN consists of a set of kernel patches and a userspace program (cman_tool). CMAN depends on CCS (only cman_tool which can optionally be used without CCS if all parameters are given on the command line.)

PackageDescription: Small Computer System Interface, or SCSI (pronounced scuzzy[1]), is a set of standards for physically connecting and transferring data between computers and peripheral devices. The SCSI standards define commands, protocols, and electrical and optical interfaces. SCSI is most commonly used for hard disks and tape drives, but it can connect a wide range of other devices, including scanners and CD drives. The SCSI standard defines command sets for specific peripheral device types; the presence of “unknown” as one of these types means that in theory it can be used as an interface to almost any device, but the standard is highly pragmatic and addressed toward commercial requirements.

While in some ways similar to an editor which permits scripted edits (such as ed), sed works by making only one pass over the input(s), and is consequently more efficient. But it is sed’s ability to filter text in a pipeline which particularly distinguishes it from other types of editors.

PackageDescription: The sharutils package contains the GNU shar utilities, a set of tools for encoding and decoding packages of files (in binary or text format) in a special plain text format called shell archives (shar). This format can be sent through email (which can be problematic for regular binary files). The shar utility supports a wide range of capabilities (compressing, uuencoding, splitting long files for multi-part mailings, providing checksums), which make it very flexible at creating shar files. After the files have been sent, the unshartool scans mail messages looking for shar files. Unshar automatically strips off mail headers and introductory text and then unpacks the sharfiles. Install sharutils if you send binary files through email very often.

PackageDescription: Sonance is a brand spankin new audio player based on the GStreamer media library and is developed on the Open Source Mono .NET Platform, written in C#. It uses the gst-sharp GStreamer bindings, which are currently only available via CVS. Version 0.2 now supports shuffle/repeat modes, playlist searching, recursive directory additions, and saves the window/widget states in GConf. Sonance may currently act as a simple drop-in XMMS/Beep replacement. It sports a basic playlist, with add/remove/clear/reorder support, and metadata support through GStreamer. Now that Sonance has a stable base, the goal is to create an entire music organization and playback platform, much like Rhythmbox and iTunes. However, Sonance will have a much smaller footprint, and will be more versatile: you dont have to utilize a music library. Sometimes its just nice to have a standalone player that isnt dependent on any kind of database. Sonance is multi-threaded. Playback is always smooth and fast, based on a solid, featureful GStreamer core, and adding lots of files to the playlist is no problem, because additions are done in a separate thread. Sonance is easy to use, simple, yet powerful, and its future is very bright..

PackageDescription: SWIG is a software development tool that connects programs written in C and C++ with a variety of high-level programming languages. SWIG is used with different types of target languages including common scripting languages such as Perl, PHP, Python, Tcl and Ruby. The list of supported languages also includes non-scripting languages such as C#, Common Lisp (CLISP, Allegro CL, CFFI, UFFI), Go language, Java, Lua, Modula-3, OCAML, Octave and R. Also several interpreted and compiled Scheme implementations (Guile, MzScheme, Chicken) are supported. SWIG is most commonly used to create high-level interpreted or compiled programming environments, user interfaces, and as a tool for testing and prototyping C/C++ software. SWIG is typically used to parse C/C++ interfaces and generate the ‘glue code’ required for the above target languages to call into the C/C++ code. SWIG can also export its parse tree in the form of XML and Lisp s-expressions. SWIG is free software and the code that SWIG generates is compatible with both commercial and non-commercial projects.

PackageDescription: Conserver is an application that allows multiple users to watch a serial console at the same time. It can log the data, allows users to take write-access of a console (one at a time), and has a variety of bells and whistles to accentuate that basic functionality. The idea is that conserver will log all your serial traffic so you can go back and review why something crashed, look at changes (if done on the console), or tie the console logs into a monitoring system (just watch the logfiles it creates). With multi-user capabilities you can work on equipment with others, mentor, train, etc. It also does all that client-server stuff so that, assuming you have a network connection, you can interact with any of the equipment from home or wherever.

PackageDescription: Termcap (terminal capability) is a software library and database used on Unix-like computers. It enables programs to use display computer terminals in a device-independent manner, which greatly simplifies the process of writing portable text mode applications. Bill Joy wrote the first termcap library[1][2] for the Berkeley Unix operating system; it has since been ported to most Unix and Unix-like environments. Joy’s design was reportedly influenced by the design of the terminal data store in the earlier Incompatible Timesharing System.[3]

PackageDescription: convmv converts filenames (not file content), directories, and even whole filesystems to a different encoding. This comes in very handy if, for example, one switches from an 8-bit locale to an UTF-8 locale or changes charsets on Samba servers. It has some smart features: it automagically recognises if a file is already UTF-8 encoded (thus partly converted filesystems can be fully moved to UTF-8) and it also takes care of symlinks. Additionally, it is able to convert from normalization form C (UTF-8 NFC) to NFD and vice-versa. This is important for interoperability with Mac OS X, for example, which uses NFD, while Linux and most other Unixes use NFC. Though it’s primary written to convert from/to UTF-8 it can also be used with almost any other charset encoding. Convmv can also be used for case conversion from upper to lower case and vice versa with virtually any charset. Note that this is a command line tool which requires at least Perl version 5.8.0.

Archives are files which contain a collection of other files plus information about them, such as their file name, owner, timestamps, and access permissions. The archive can be another file on the disk, a magnetic tape, or a pipe. GNU cpio supports the following archive formats: binary,old ASCII, new ASCII, crc, HPUX binary, HPUX old ASCII, old tar and POSIX.1tar. By default, cpio creates binary format archives, so that they are compatible with older cpio programs. When it is extracting files from archives, cpio automatically recognizes which kind of archive it is readingand can read archives created on machines with a different byte-order. Install cpio if you need a program to manage file archives.

PackageDescription: Unifdef is useful for removing #ifdef’ed lines from a file while otherwise leaving the file alone. You specify which symbols are defined or undefined with -D and -U flags, and unifdef removes the corresponding ifdefs, and the enclosed code if appropriate. It’s especially useful for removing those “#ifdef BROKEN” and “#ifdef PRIVATE” clauses from code before you release it. Unifdef acts on #if, #ifdef, #ifndef, #elif, #else, and #endif lines, and it knows only enough about C and C++ to know when one of these is inactive because it is inside a comment or a single or double quote.

The guest can be referred to based on its name, ID , or UUID . If the guest is not already running, then the viewer can be told to wait until is starts before attempting to connect to the console The viewer can connect to remote hosts to lookup the console information and then also connect to the remote console using the same network transport.

PackageDescription: virt-what is a shell script which can be used to detect if the program is running in a virtual machine. The program prints out a list of “facts” about the virtual machine, derived from heuristics. One fact is printed per line. If nothing is printed and the script exits with code 0 (no error), then it can mean either that the program is running on bare-metal or the program is running inside a type of virtual machine which we don’t know about or can’t detect. Current types of virtualization detected: – hyperv Microsoft Hyper-V – kvm Linux Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM) – openvz OpenVZ or Virtuozzo – powervm_lx86 IBM PowerVM Lx86 Linux/x86 emulator – qemu QEMU (unaccelerated) – uml User-Mode Linux (UML) – virtage Hitachi Virtualization Manager (HVM) Virtage LPAR – virtualbox VirtualBox – virtualpc Microsoft VirtualPC – vmware VMware – xen Xen – xen-dom0 Xen dom0 (privileged domain) – xen-domU Xen domU (paravirtualized guest domain) – xen-hvm Xen guest fully virtualized (HVM)

PackageDescription: A virtual LAN, commonly known as a VLAN, is a group of hosts with a common set of requirements that communicate as if they were attached to the same broadcast domain, regardless of their physical location. A VLAN has the same attributes as a physical LAN, but it allows for end stations to be grouped together even if they are not located on the same network switch. Network reconfiguration can be done through software instead of physically relocating devices.

PackageDescription: This package provides Python bindings for libvolume_key, a library for manipulating storage volume encryption keys and storing them separately from volumes. The main goal of the software is to allow restoring access to an encrypted hard drive if the primary user forgets the passphrase. The encryption key back up can also be useful for extracting data after a hardware or software failure that corrupts the header of the encrypted volume, or to access the company data after an employee leaves abruptly. volume_key currently supports only the LUKS volume encryption format. Support for other formats is possible, some formats are planned for future releases.

PackageDescription: CrackLib tests passwords to determine whether they match certainsecurity-oriented characteristics, with the purpose of stopping users from choosing passwords that are easy to guess. CrackLib performs several tests on passwords: it tries to generate words from a username and gecos entry and checks those words against the password; it checksfor simplistic patterns in passwords; and it checks for the password in a dictionary. CrackLib is actually a library containing a particular C function which is used to check the password, as well as other Cfunctions. CrackLib is not a replacement for a passwd program; it must be used in conjunction with an existing passwd program. Install the cracklib package if you need a program to check users’passwords to see if they are at least minimally secure. If you install CrackLib, you will also want to install the cracklib-dicts package.

PackageDescription: The Linux software watchdog is a timer that continuously counts down from a specified start value. Once it reaches zero a function named watchdog_fire is called that logs the event and initiates a hard reset. A watchdog daemon is therefore needed to refresh the timer. As long as the daemon is present the timer will never fire, but if the daemon stops working for some reason, the timer will fire and reboot the machine. However, with no additional hardware, the watchdog is not able to recover from every possible hang up. For instance, if the interrupt system itself hangs up, the software watchdog is no cure at all.

PackageDescription: A kernel debugging utility, allowing gdb like syntax. The core analysis suite is a self-contained tool that can be used to investigate either live systems, kernel core dumps created from the Kernel Core Dump patch offered by Mission Critical Linux, or kernel core dumps created by the LKCD patch offered by SGI. o The tool is loosely based on the SVR4 crash command, but has been completely integrated with gdb in order to be able to display formatted kernel data structures, disassemble source code, etc. o The current set of available commands consist of common kernel core analysis tools such as a context-specific stack traces, source code disassembly, kernel variable displays, memory display, dumps of linked-lists, etc. In addition, any gdb command may be entered, which in turn will be passed onto the gdb module for execution. o There are several commands that delve deeper into specific kernel subsystems, which also serve as templates for kernel developers to create new commands for analysis of a specific area of interest. Adding a new command is a simple affair, and a quick recompile adds it to the command menu. o The intent is to make the tool independent of Linux version dependencies, building in recognition of major kernel code changes so as to adapt to new kernel versions, while maintaining backwards compatibility.

This is useful for comparing two texts in which a few words have been changed and for which paragraphs have been refilled. It works by creating two temporary files, one word per line, and then executes diff on these files. It collects the diff output and uses it to produce a nicer display of word differences between the original files.

PackageDescription: xmltex implements a non validating parser for documents matching the W3C XML Namespaces Recommendation. The system may just be used to parse the file (expanding entity references and normalising namespace declarations) in which case it records a trace of the parse on the terminal. Normally however the information from the parse is used to trigger TeX typesetting code. Declarations (in TeX syntax) are provided as part of xmltex to associate TeX code with the start and end of each XML element, attributes, processing instructions, and with unicode character data.

PackageDescription: From SuSE Linux 8.1 on, YaST2 comes with a new, powerful package manager. It supersedes the classic YaST2 single package selection and integrates the YaST Online Update (YOU) and post-installation add-on selection at the same time. It lays the foundation for supporting multiple installation sources like a traditional set of SuSE CDs, add-on product CDs, patch CDs, FTP servers or even local directories – all of which may contain software packages to install. Specially optimized versions were implemented for both graphical user interface (the YaST2 Qt UI) or text interface (the YaST2 NCurses UI), providing each type of user with the tool that best fits his needs.

PackageDescription: CVS means Concurrent Version System; it is a version control system which can record the history of your files (usually,but not always, source code). CVS only stores the differences between versions, instead of every version of every fileyou’ve ever created. CVS also keeps a log of who, when and why changes occurred, among other aspects. CVS is very helpful for managing releases and controllingthe concurrent editing of source files among multipleauthors. Instead of providing version control for a collection of files in a single directory, CVS providesversion control for a hierarchical collection ofdirectories consisting of revision controlled files. These directories and files can then be combined togetherto form a software release. Install the cvs package if you need to use a version control system.

PackageDescription: The Network Information Service (NIS) is a system that provides network information (login names, passwords, home directories, group information) to all of the machines on a network. NIS can allow users to log in on any machine on the network, as long as the machine has the NIS client programs running and the user’s password is recorded inthe NIS passwd database. NIS was formerly known as Sun Yellow Pages(YP). This package provides the ypbind daemon. The ypbind daemon binds NIS clients to an NIS domain. Ypbind must be running on any machines running NIS client programs. Install the ypbind package on any machines running NIS client programs (included in the yp-tools package). If you need an NIS server, youalso need to install the ypserv package to a machine on your network.

PackageDescription: zlib is designed to be a free, general-purpose, legally unencumbered — that is, not covered by any patents — lossless data-compression library for use on virtually any computer hardware and operating system. The zlib data format is itself portable across platforms. Unlike the LZW compression method used in Unix compress(1) and in the GIF image format, the compression method currently used in zlib essentially never expands the data. (LZW can double or triple the file size in extreme cases.) zlib’s memory footprint is also independent of the input data and can be reduced, if necessary, at some cost in compression. A more precise, technical discussion of both points is available on another page.

PackageDescription: GNU a2ps is an Any to PostScript filter. Of course it processes plain text files, but also pretty prints quite a few popular languages.  Its slogan is precisely “ Do The Right Thing ”, which means that though it is highly configurable, everything was made so that a novice user can do complicated PostScript manipulations. For instance, it has the ability to delegate the processing of some files to other filters (such as groff, texi2dvi, dvips, gzip etc.), what allows a uniform treatment (n-up, page selection, duplex etc.) of heterogeneous files.

PackageDescription: The devfsd programme is a daemon, run by the system bootscripts which can provide for intelligent management ofdevice entries in the Device Filesystem (devfs). As part of its setup phase devfsd creates certain symbolic links which are compiled into the code. These links are required by /usr/src/linux/Documentation/devices.txt. This behaviour may change in future revisions .devfsd will read the special control file .devfsd in amounted devfs, listening for the creation and removal of device entries (this is termed a change operation). For each change operation, devfsd can take many actions. The daemon will normally run itself in the background and send messages to syslog. The opening of the syslog service is automatically delayed until /dev/log is created. At startup, before switching to daemon mode, devfsd willscan the mounted device tree and will generate synthetic REGISTER events for each leaf node.

PackageDescription: In the Linux kernel, the device-mapper serves as a generic framework to map one block device onto another. It forms the foundation of LVM2 and EVMS, software RAIDs, dm-crypt disk encryption, and offers additional features such as file-system snapshots.  Device-mapper works by processing data passed in from a virtual block device, that it itself provides, and then passing the resultant data on to another block device.

PackageDescription: DHCPv6 is the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6. Although IPv6’s stateless address autoconfiguration removes the primary motivation for DHCP in IPv6, DHCPv6 can still be used to assign addresses statefully if the network administrator desires more control over addressing. It can also be used to distribute other configuration information as is the practice in IPv4. A notable case are Domain Name System servers used on a network, albeit other mechanism exist for this in the Neighbor Discovery Protocol.[1]

PackageDescription: The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a service that runs at the application layer of the TCP/IP protocol stack to dynamically assign IP addresses to DHCP clients, and to allocate TCP/IP configuration information to DHCP clients. This includes subnet mask information, default gateway IP addresses, DNS IP addresses, and WINS IP addresses. The DHCP protocol is derived from the Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) protocol. The DHCP server is configured with a predetermined pool of IP addresses (scopes), from which it allocates IP addresses to DHCP clients. During the boot process, DHCP clients request IP addresses, and obtain leases for IP addresses from the DHCP server.

PackageDescription: The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is an auto configuration protocol used on IP networks. Computers that are connected to IP networks must be configured before they can communicate with other computers on the network. DHCP allows a computer to be configured automatically, eliminating the need for intervention by a network administrator. It also provides a central database for keeping track of computers that have been connected to the network. This prevents two computers from accidentally being configured with the same IP address.  In the absence of DHCP, hosts may be manually configured with an IP address. Alternatively IPv6 hosts may use stateless address autoconfiguration to generate an IP address. IPv4 hosts may use link-local addressing to achieve limited local connectivity.

PackageDescription: Dynamic Probes is a linux debugger that can be used to insert software probes dynamically into executing code modules. When a probe is fired, a user-written probe-handler is executed. The probe-handler is a program written in an assembly-like language, based on the Reverse Polish Notation (RPN). Instructions are provided to enable the probe-handler to access all the hardware registers, system data structures and memory.  DProbes operates under the most extreme software conditions such as debugging a deep rooted operating system problem in a live environment, for example in the page-manager of the kernel or perhaps a problem that will not re-create easily in either a lab or production environment. For such inaccessible problem scenarios Dynamic Probes not only offers a technique for gathering diagnostic information but has a high probability of successful outcome without the need to build custom modules for debugging purposes.

PackageDescription: A file system (often also written as filesystem) is a method of storing and organizing computer files and their data. Essentially, it organizes these files into a database for the storage, organization, manipulation, and retrieval by the computer’s operating system.  File systems are used on data storage devices such as hard disks or CD-ROMs to maintain the physical location of the files. Beyond this, they might provide access to data on a file server by acting as clients for a network protocol (e.g., NFS, SMB, or 9P clients), or they may be virtual and exist only as an access method for virtual data (e.g., procfs). It is distinguished from a directory service and registry.

PackageDescription: firstboot is the program that runs on the first boot of a Fedora or Red Hat Enterprise Linux system that allows you to configure more things than the installer allows.  It also has a mode known as reconfig mode to let you reconfigure user settings that were originally set in the installer. This is generally useful to IHVs shipping hardware to an end user so that the end user can do things such as select their language, set their root password and configure their network. To start this mode, touch /etc/reconfigSys on your system.  firstboot has a modular architecture such that each screen is a separate python module. This allows firstboot to be a framework that requires no knowledge of the underlying modules. The primary benefit of this is that additional steps can be added without having to modify firstboot itself. The Modules page describes how to create a firstboot module.

PackageDescription: There are several advanced photo management programs that you can use to collect, organize, enjoy, and share all those pictures you have been taking with your digital camera. Which one is the best for you may depend on which version of Linux or which desktop environment you are using. For KDE based distributions, like Kubuntu, DigiKam works great. If you are using GNOME, the default desktop environment for Ubuntu, F-Spot is a good choice. F-Spot is actually pre-installed in Ubuntu, and you can directly launch it from the Applications -> Graphics menu.  If you connect your digital camera through a USB connection, F-Spot can detect it and offers to import the pictures. You can than categorize them, edit them, run them in a slide show, or use any of the other functions.  As an alternative Google offers Picasa, also a program for comprehensively locating and organizing images on a computer system. It is not a native Linux application, but uses Wine when it runs on Linux.

PackageDescription: Old version of the F(?) Virtual Window Manager This package contains the old version of the FVWM windows manager. It is no longer supported upstream, having been replaced by FVWM 2, and so no non-Debian-related bugs will be fixed unless someone else provides a patch. You probably only want to use this package instead of the fvwm package if you know what you are doing or have very specific requirements. FVWM is a fairly small window manager which provides a three-dimensional appearance and a virtual desktop, complete with colour icons. You will need to install the fvwm-common package if you want the xpmroot command and some icons, along with manual pages for the modules.

Messenger and Zephyr protocols. As the name suggests, it was originally designed for using AOL’s Instant Messenger service (you can sign up at http:// www.aim.aol.com/). Consequently it contains many of the same features as AOL’s IM client, as well as incorporating many new features, such as the multiple protocol support. This version is compiled without GNOME support, making Gaim a stand-alone Gtk+ program.

PackageDescription: Utilities for Advanced Power Management (APM) On laptop computers, the Advanced Power Management (APM) support provides access to battery status information and may help you to conserve battery power, depending on your laptop and the APM implementation. The apmd program also lets you run arbitrary programs when APM events happen (for example, you can eject PCMCIA devices when you suspend, or change hard drive timeouts when you connect the battery). This package contains apmd(8), a daemon for logging and acting on APM events; and apm(1), a client that prints the information in /proc/apm in a readable format. apmd is notified of APM events by the APM driver in the kernel. Recent Debian kernels are built with APM support but it is disabled by default. You need to boot the kernel with the “apm=on” option if you want to enable the driver. (You may need to add this option to your lilo command line.)

PackageDescription: Glitz is an OpenGL image compositing library. Glitz provides Porter/Duff compositing of images and implicit mask generation for geometric primitives including trapezoids, triangles, and rectangles.  The semantics of glitz are designed to precisely match the specification of the X Render extension. Glitz does not only implement X Render features like component alpha and image transformations, but also support for additional features like convolution filters and color gradients, which are not currently part of the X Render specification.  The performance and capabilities of glitz are much dependent on graphics hardware. Glitz does not in any way handle software fall-backs when graphics hardware is insufficient. However, glitz will report if any requested operation cannot be carried out by graphics hardware, hence making a higher level software layer responsible for appropriate actions.

PackageDescription: Argus is an IP transaction auditing tool that categorizes IP packets which match the boolean expression into a protocol-specific network transaction model. Argus reports on the transactions that it discovers, as they occur.  Designed to run as a daemon, argus generally reads packets directly from a network interface, and writes the transaction status information to a log file or open socket connected to an argus client (such as ra(1)). Argus can also read packet information from tcpdump(1) , snoop(1) or NLANR’s Moat Time Sequence Header raw packet files. Argus can also be configured to write its transaction logs to stdout.  Argus provides access control for its socket connection facility using tcp_wrapper technology. Please refer to the tcp_wrapper distribution for a complete description.

PackageDescription: gpart: Guess PC disk partition table, find lost partitions Gpart is a tool which tries to guess the primary partition table of a PC-type disk in case the primary partition table in sector 0 is damaged, incorrect or deleted. It is also good at finding and listing the types, locations, and sizes of inadvertently-deleted partitions, both primary and logical. It gives you the information you need to manually re-create them (using fdisk, cfdisk, sfdisk, etc.). The guessed table can also be written to a file or (if you firmly believe the guessed table is entirely correct) directly to a disk device. Supported (guessable) filesystem or partition types: * BeOS filesystem type. * FreeBSD/NetBSD/386BSD disklabel sub-partitioning scheme used on Intel platforms. * Linux second extended filesystem. * MS-DOS FAT12/16/32 “filesystems”. * IBM OS/2 High Performance filesystem. * Linux LVM physical volumes (LVM by Heinz Mauelshagen). * Linux swap partitions (versions 0 and 1). * The Minix operating system filesystem type. * MS Windows NT/2000 filesystem. * QNX 4.x filesystem. * The Reiser filesystem (version 3.5.X, X ) 11). * Sun Solaris on Intel platforms uses a sub-partitioning scheme on PC hard disks similar to the BSD disklabels. * Silicon Graphics’ journalling filesystem for Linux. Other types may be added relatively easily, as separately compiled modules. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

PackageDescription: gpg2 is the OpenPGP part of the GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG). It is a tool to provide digital encryption and signing services using the OpenPGP standard. gpg2 features complete key management and all bells and whistles you can expect from a decent OpenPGP implementation.  In contrast to the standalone version gpg, which is more suited for server and embedded platforms, this version is installed under the name gpg2 and more targeted to the desktop as it requires several other modules to be installed. The standalone version will be kept maintained and it is possible to install both versions on the same system. If you need to use different configuration files, you should make use of something like ‘gpg.conf-2’ instead of just ‘gpg.conf’.

PackageDescription: GnuPG Made Easy (GPGME) is a library designed to make access to GnuPG easier for applications. It provides a High-Level Crypto API for encryption, decryption, signing, signature verification and key management. Currently it uses GnuPG as its backend but the API isn’t restricted to this engine; in fact we have already developed a backend for CMS (S/MIME).  Because the direct use of GnuPG from an application can be a complicated programming task, it is suggested that all software should try to use GPGME instead. This way bug fixes or improvements can be done at a central place and every application benefits from this.  Especially authors of MUAs should consider to use GPGME. It is even planned to create a set of standard widgets for common key selection tasks.

Its main feature is that it does a superior job of suggesting possible replacements for a misspelled word than just about any other spell checker out there for the English language. Unlike Ispell, Aspell can also easily check documents in UTF-8 without having to use a special dictionary. Aspell will also do its best to respect the current locale setting. Other advantages over Ispell include support for using multiple dictionaries at once and intelligently handling personal dictionaries when more than one Aspell process is open at once.

PackageDescription: In computing, a hard link is a directory entry that associates a name with a file on a file system. A directory is itself a special kind of file that contains a list of such entries. The term is particular to file systems which allow multiple hard links to be created for the same file. This has the effect of creating multiple names for the same file, causing an aliasing effect: if the file is opened by one of its names, and changes are made to its content, then these changes will also be visible when the file is opened by an alternative name. By contrast, a soft link on such filesystems is not a link to a file itself, but to a file name; this also creates aliasing, but in a different way.

PackageDescription: hpoj: HP OfficeJet Linux driver (hpoj) This software provides Linux support for most “multi-function” (or “all-in-one”) peripherals from Hewlett-Packard, including OfficeJet, LaserJet, and Printer/Scanner/ Copier (“PSC”) products. It consists of: – Low-level drivers and libraries to communicate with the device. Depending on your hardware and operating system configuration, you may connect devices directly to your workstation with a parallel port or USB (Universal Serial Bus), or to a LAN (Local Area Network) using certain models of HP JetDirect print servers. – An application programming interface (API) known as “PTAL” (Peripheral Transport Abstraction Library) that hides the differences in accessing devices connected via parallel, USB, or JetDirect. – Printing support, largely powered by ghostscript, the HP inkjet driver (for selected models), and one of various print spoolers (Berkeley lpd, gnulpr, LPRng, CUPS, PDQ, etc.) that may already be installed on your computer. – Scanning support, powered either by Scanner Access Now Easy (SANE) or by “ptal-hp scan”, a command-line application provided with the hpoj package. – Graphical and command-line applications to access various features of the peripheral, such as displaying status of the device and setting the clock. From Debian 3.0r0 APT

PackageDescription: WWW search system for an intranet or small internet The ht://Dig system is a complete world wide web indexing and searching system for a small domain or intranet. This system is not meant to replace the need for powerful internet-wide search systems like Lycos, Infoseek, Webcrawler and AltaVista. Instead it is meant to cover the search needs for a single company, campus, or even a particular sub section of a web site. As opposed to some WAIS-based or web-server based search engines, ht://Dig can span several web servers at a site. The type of these different web servers doesn’t matter as long as they understand the HTTP 1.0 protocol. Features: * Intranet searching * It is free * Robot exclusion is supported * Boolean expression searching * Configurable search results * Fuzzy searching * Searching of HTML and text files * Keywords can be added to HTML documents * Email notification of expired documents * A Protected server can be indexed * Searches on subsections of the database * Full source code included * The depth of the search can be limited * Full support for the ISO-Latin-1 character set

It is derived from an existing product by the same software house, called NetMail, and retains many of the architectural features of that software. However, important components such as the mail store are being re-developed to integrate new functionality (such as search) and new features (such as calendaring, using the calendar server protocol CalDAV). As such, when complete it will be a more modern system with better support for common standards in comparison to the earlier NetMail product.

PackageDescription: IcedTea is a software development and integration project launched by Red Hat in June 2007.[1] The initial goal was to make the Java OpenJDK software which Sun Microsystems released as free software in 2007 usable without requiring any other software that is not free software and hence make it possible to add OpenJDK to Fedora and other Linux distributions that insist on free software. This was met and a version of IcedTea based on OpenJDK was packaged with Fedora 8 in November 2007.

An attribute may be defined or undefined. If it is defined, its value may be empty or non-empty.  Extended attributes are extensions to the normal attributes which are associated with all inodes in the system (i.e. the stat(2) data). They are often used to provide additional functionality to a filesystem – for example, additional security features such as Access Control Lists (ACLs) may be implemented using extended attributes.

PackageDescription: The subsystem in UNIX responsible for starting most of the network services. This program works from the principle that one service can listen for incoming traffic on a socket, and when such traffic appears, it can launch the appropriate service to handle it. This allows a single box to support many services without actually having them all run at the same time. The file /etc/inetd.conf configures this service. Key point: A common backdoor technique is to place a root shell program in inetd.conf.

PackageDescription: News transport system `InterNetNews’ by the ISC and Rich Salz This is INN version 1.X, provided for sites which are not ready to upgrade to 2.X yet. New installations of INN should use Debian’s inn2 package instead. The news transport is the part of the system that stores the articles and the lists of which groups are available and so on, and provides those articles on request to users. It receives news (either posted locally or from a newsfeed site), files it, and passes it on to any downstream sites. Each article is kept for a period of time and then deleted (this is known as `expiry’). By default Debian’s INN will install in a fairly simple `local-only’ configuration. In order to make use of the services provided by INN you’ll have to use a user-level newsreader program such as trn. The newsreader is the program that fetches articles from the server and shows them to the user, remembering which the user has seen so that they don’t get shown again. It also provides the posting interface for the user.

It may also be used with the –dumpregs option to show the current IO address and IRQ of the modem’s serial port. The isapnp command may be put into a startup file so that it runs each time you start the computer and thus will configure ISA PnP devices. It is able to do this even if your BIOS doesn’t support PnP. See Plug-and-Play-HOWTO.

PackageDescription: In computing, iSCSI (pronounced /a??sk?zi/ “eye-scuzzy”), is an abbreviation of Internet Small Computer System Interface, an Internet Protocol (IP)-based storage networking standard for linking data storage facilities. By carrying SCSI commands over IP networks, iSCSI is used to facilitate data transfers over intranets and to manage storage over long distances. iSCSI can be used to transmit data over local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), or the Internet and can enable location-independent data storage and retrieval. The protocol allows clients (called initiators) to send SCSI commands (CDBs) to SCSI storage devices (targets) on remote servers. It is a popular Storage Area Network (SAN) protocol, allowing organizations to consolidate storage into data center storage arrays while providing hosts (such as database and web servers) with the illusion of locally-attached disks. Unlike traditional Fibre Channel, which requires special-purpose cabling, iSCSI can be run over long distances using existing network infrastructure.

PackageDescription: International Ispell (an interactive spelling corrector) Ispell corrects spelling in plain text, LaTeX, sgml/html/xml, and nroff files. [x]Emacs and jed have nice interfaces to ispell, and ispell works from many other tools and from the command line as well. No dictionaries are included in this package. Ispell looks in /usr/lib/ispell/default.{aff,hash} and in / usr/share/dict/words by default. Those files may be provided, respectively, by an ispell-dictionary package and a wordlist package. (You must have an ispell dictionary before you can use ispell; a wordlist is only required for ispell’s (L)ookup command.) This ispell package supports either the “new-style” idict-(language) dictionaries or the “old-style” i(language) dictionaries. As of February 2001, only old-style dictionaries are available, because the dictionaries-common standards and package have not been finalized. When dictionaries-common and the idict-( language) dictionaries become available, this version of ispell will be able to use them. (For more information, please see the dictionaries-common package and ispell’s Debian changelog).

PackageDescription: Rip and encode CDs with one command Jack has been developed with one main goal: making MP3s or OGGs without having to worry. There is nearly no way that an incomplete rip goes unnoticed, e.g. jack compares WAV and OGG file sizes when continuing from a previous run. Jack also checks your HD space before doing anything (even keeps some MB free). Jack is different from other such tools in a number of ways: – it supports different rippers and encoders – it is very configurable – it doesn’t need X – it can “rip” virtual CD images like the ones created by cdrdao – when using cdparanoia, cdparanoia’s status information is displayed for all tracks, so you can see if something went wrong – it uses sophisticated disk space management, i.e. it schedules it’s ripping/ encoding processes depending on available space. – freedb query, file renaming and id3 tagging – it can resume work after it has been interrupted. If all tracks have been ripped, it doesn’t even need the CD anymore, even if you want to do a freedb query. – it can do a freedb query based on OGGs alone, like if you don’t remember from which CD those OGGs came from. – freedb submissions

PackageDescription: Autoconf is an extensible package of M4 macros that produce shell scripts to automatically configure software source code packages. These scripts can adapt the packages to many kinds of UNIX-like systems without manual user intervention. Autoconf creates a configuration script for a package from a template file that lists the operating system features that the package can use, in the form of M4 macro calls.  Producing configuration scripts using Autoconf requires GNU M4. You should install GNU M4 (at least version 1.4.6, although 1.4.13 or later is recommended) before configuring Autoconf, so that Autoconf’s configure script can find it. The configuration scripts produced by Autoconf are self-contained, so their users do not need to have Autoconf (or GNU M4).

PackageDescription: The Linux kernel is an operating system kernel used by the Linux family of Unix-like operating systems.[6] It is one of the most prominent examples of free and open source software.[7]  The Linux kernel is released under the GNU General Public License version 2 (GPLv2),[4] (plus some firmware images with various licenses), and is developed by contributors worldwide. Day-to-day development takes place on the Linux kernel mailing list.  The Linux kernel was initially conceived and created by Finnish computer science student[8] Linus Torvalds in 1991. Linux rapidly accumulated developers and users who adopted code from other free software projects for use with the new operating system.[9] The Linux kernel has received contributions from thousands of programmers.[10] Many Linux distributions have been released based upon the Linux kernel.

When invoked, after some initialization (which will take about a few to 30  seconds  depending  on  your  machine)  kinput2 waits quietly for a Japanese text input  request  from  another  client  (i.e.  no  windows appear).   When  kinput2  receives  a  request, it pops up a window and starts conversion process. It sends the  converted  text  back  to  the client when the text is fixed.  Kinput2  has  some big improvements over its predecessor, kinput, which was contributed to X11R4.

PackageDescription: In computing, klibc is a minimalistic subset of the standard C library developed by H. Peter Anvin. It was developed mainly to be used during the Linux startup process, and it is part of the early user space, i.e. components used during kernel startup, but which do not run in kernel mode.[1] These components do not have access to the standard library (usually glibc) used by normal userspace programs.  The development of klibc library was part of the 2002 effort to move some Linux initialization code out of the kernel.[2][3][4] According to its documentation, the klibc library is optimized for correctness and small size.[1] Because of its design, klibc is also technically suitable for embedded software in general. Unlike many other open source libraries, klibc is licensed under the full GPL license, which (unlike LGPL) imposes itself on any code linked with it. (This only applies to klibc as a whole due to embedding some Linux kernel derived files; most of the library source code is actually[5] available under a BSD licence from UCB or the Historical Permission Notice and Disclaimer.) This may limit its applicability to commercial embedded software.[6]  During the Linux startup process, klibc is loaded from within a temporary RAM file system, initramfs. It is incorporated by default into initial RAM file systems that are created by the mkinitramfs script in Debian [7] and Ubuntu. Furthermore it has a set of small Unix utilities that are useful in early user space: cpio, dash, fstype, mkdir, mknod, mount, nfsmount, run-init, etc.

PackageDescription: ModBackhand is an Apache module that provides load balancing and high availability features for a cluster of webservers.  Because it is part of Apache it works on a HTTP request basis (which also means it cannot be used for any other type of service, ie mail), this allows for smarter and more flexible distribution of requests. It also allows for features not found in lower level balancers like the affinity for servers based on user session, thus easing application development or clustering of existing applications that don’t have a shared session system. ModBackhand is also cross platform, allowing almost all Unices (that run Apache) to do the balancing and also support for Windows based application servers.  ModBackhand allows you to also have the balancer on a machine which can also serve the actual requests, have it standalone on a machine with a stripped down Apache or even have multiple balancers for fault tolerance.  It works by the participating servers in the cluster broadcasting (Multicast can also be used for multiple clusters on the same network) stats about themselves (Load, CPU idle time, spare Apache processes, etc.) allowing for the balancer to make informed decisions about distributing requests instead of a naive round robin approach (such as DNS RR).

PackageDescription: Linux color management has the same goal as the color management systems (CMS) for other operating systems: to achieve the best possible color reproduction throughout an imaging workflow from its source (camera, video, scanner), onto imaging software (CinePaint, Digikam, GIMP, Krita, Scribus …) and finally its output (monitor, video projector, printer…). In particular, color management attempts to support WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) on-screen previewing (soft-proofing) ability for color work such as retouching prior to printing. Note that in practice, best is determined according to some algorithm and may not correspond well to what a human eye would consider best.

PackageDescription: Less is a program similar to more (1), but which allows backward movement in the file as well as forward movement. Also, less does not have to read the entire input file before starting, so with large input files it starts up faster than text editors like vi (1). Less uses termcap (or terminfo on some systems), so it can run on a variety of terminals. There is even limited support for hardcopy terminals. (On a hardcopy terminal, lines which should be printed at the top of the screen are prefixed with a caret.)

PackageDescription: Sophisticated command-line FTP/HTTP client programs Lftp is a file retrieving tool that supports FTP and HTTP protocols under both IPv4 and IPv6. Lftp has an amazing set of features, while preserving its interface as simple and easy as possible. The main two advantages over other ftp clients are reliability and ability to perform tasks in background. It will reconnect and reget the file being transferred if the connection broke. You can start a transfer in background and continue browsing on the ftp site. It does this all in one process. When you have started background jobs and feel you are done, you can just exit lftp and it automatically moves to nohup mode and completes the transfers. It has also such nice features as reput and mirror. It can also download a file as soon as possible by using several connections at the same time. Lftp can also be scriptable, it can be used to mirror sites, it let you copy files among remote servers (even between FTP and HTTP). It has an extensive online help. It supports bookmarks, and connecting to several ftp/http sites at the same time. This package also includes lftpget – A simple non-interactive tool for downloading files.

PackageDescription: Libaio is an event-driven programming environment intended for modern CMPs. The interface to the library, although similar to some existing event-driven libraries, is new, relatively untried, and still a work in progress. The author is less than fond of continuation-passing style (aka: event-driven style) as a programming model for end users and hopes eventually to develop a source-to-source compiler in the spirit of Tame to ease the task of programming with events. Unlike the SMP version of libasync, libaio makes concurrency explicit through barriers and locks and sports a variety of more sophisticated schedulers.
